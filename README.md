# Read Me Generator: Using ES6 & NodeJs

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

## Installation
In order to get this application to start generating README files, the user must install npm packages:
* npm init
* npm install inquirer

## Usage

Open up the terminal of the index file and run the application using `node index.js`. The application will then ask the users a series of questions using the `inquirer` package to generate and store user inputs. 

Once all fields are entered, the application will execute `file.writeFileSync` to create a README file with all user fields.
